### Changes in the autogenerated files not to forget

- In *alembic.ini*, find `sqlalchemy.url` and set it to `sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///pet_app.db`
- In *env.py*, find `target_metadata`(line 20) and add `from models import Base` above it. Next, set target_metadata to `target_metadata = Base.metadata`
- In *env.py*, replace line 68 with ```python            connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata, render_as_batch=True```
